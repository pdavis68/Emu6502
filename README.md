# Emu6502

6502 CPU emulator.

Very basic so far. Cool AddressMode/OpCode design as well as some instructon implementations stolen from https://github.com/gianlucag/mos6502

This is just a barebones CPU emulator. The plan is to add event handlers for reading and writing memory. These could then be used by hosting applications to plug-in functionality for other things (like interfacing with hardware, or emulating other chips. Think Atari's GTIA or Antic chips.)
